I invest in and build Bitcoin businesses and projects at [19d6](https://19d6.ch).

I write here on this site about anything that interests me.

I work at [Bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com) and [GS,](/glockstore) and have previously been the Director of Marketing at [Praxis.](/praxis) Before and during that time, I did marketing for Voice & Exit, The Foundation for Economic Education, and The Objective Standard, among other companies.

I track down and publish rare and lost books at [Makgill Press.](https://press.makgill.ch)

I research the history of Bitcoin, the life and works of Sir George Makgill, and Operation Atlantis—an attempt at building a startup private city according to Objectivist principles—and in 2020 I launched the [Operation Atlantis Digital Archive](https://operationatlantis.ch) based on primary source material that had been missing for nearly 60 years.

I'm the editor of two upcoming books—one on Timothy C. May, the famous cypherpunk, and another which is a collection of the journals of Leonard E. Read.

I dropped out of the University of Michigan during my Sophomore year as a Classics major and am currently on the Board of Directors at the [Paideia Institute.](https://www.paideiainstitute.org/)

I live in [redacted].

In past lives, I've lectured on economics and career building at universities around the world.

See what I'm up to [now.](/now)
